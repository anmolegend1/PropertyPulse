This site is my little brainchild, made to showcase my web development skills while also helping people find or list properties for rent.

           </li><section className="ml-4 mt-2 bg-blue-200">
            Keep it real: Whether you’re listing a property or looking for one, make sure the info you provide is legit. Nobody likes surprises, especially in rentals!
            Be cool: Treat other users with respect. This is a drama-free zone.

           </li> <section className="ml-4 mt-2 bg-blue-200">
            Don’t upload fake listings or mess around with the site’s functionality.
Avoid using this site for anything illegal (obviously).
No spamming, trolling, or otherwise being a nuisance.

           </li><section className="ml-4 mt-2 bg-blue-200">
            This site is just a tool I built to help you find or rent properties. I can’t:

Guarantee that all the listings are 100% accurate (but I hope they are!).
Mediate if you and another user have a disagreement.
Take responsibility if something goes wrong with your rental deal.
